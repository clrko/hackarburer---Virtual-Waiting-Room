## The project

We decided to design a **virtual assistant for medical practitioners** which helps managing waiting time during a **tele consultation**. 
It is a **white-label web application** that will address all the stakeholders in the teleconsultation market while meeting the interoperability standards.

#### The objectives are
* improve the user experience as the patient will be reassured and more inclined to stay connected. 
* boost the practitioner's productivity as his work will be refocused in only one interface.
* take advantage of the patient's waiting time to collect and qualify his personal and medical data in a highly secure way.


## Technologies

* React.js (Hooks)
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3

#### Virtual waiting room

 - a virtual queue which shows user's turn among the patients and user's webcam 
 - the first counter recalls how many people are scheduled before the user
 - the second counter is an estimated waiting time which calculates waiting time
 - a chatbot confirming personal information and asking basic check up questions

 - inform a potential delay to all patients

## Next step
* 'Waiting time' supervised by Machine Learning
* Highly Customizable pre-interview questions & smart chatbot
* Reglementary and informational display in the waiting room

## In the project directory, you can run:
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

These commands install the dependencies and start the app in the developement mode.
